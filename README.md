# avrpt
AVR Project Tool - is organizing my Arduino Projects - it create blank Scripts, debug the Code, compile and upload the finish Code to Arduino Uno

This is my first github-respository. Sorry for my bad english, iam a german guy and i not so often speak english :D
avrpt is my first published Program. It is programmed in Bash and use 'Screen' and 'Arduino-mk' to organize my Arduino-Projects. I was programming and testing it with my Computer on a Ubuntu/KUbuntu OS, with my Arduino Uno (Arduino Genuino).
This Program is complete Open Source Code! Maybe you can help me, to make this Program better.
If you will contact me, you can Mail me. Please recomment. I hope you enjoy.

# About AVR Project Tool
This Tool can create, edit, compile and upload new Projects to Arduino Uno. Maybe in the Future it can handle some other Boards. I was programming it in Linux-Bash. This program is in the Beta-Phase! You use it on your own risk!
If you find some Bugs, please comment or fix it. This Program is completely Open Source. If you touch, please update the Versionnumber and add your Name with an valid Email-Address inside the Program and let stay my Brandmarks inside it :)
Thanks!
